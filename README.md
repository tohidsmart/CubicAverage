Cubic Weight Example
A parcel measuring 40cm long (0.4m) x 20cm high (0.2m) x 30cm wide (0.3m) is equal to 0.024 cubic metres.
Multiplied by the conversion factor of 250 gives a cubic weight of 6kg.

0.4m x 0.2m x 0.3m = 0.024m3
0.024m3 x 250 = 6kg
Assume that
All dimensions are provided in centimetres.
All weights are provided in grams.
